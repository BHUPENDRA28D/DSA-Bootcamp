## Introduction

This repository is designed as a step-by-step guide to strengthen your programming skills. It covers the fundamentals of C, progresses to C++ with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming, and delves into essential Data Structures, Algorithms, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Languages

C: You can find the C resources in the /C directory.
C++: You can find the C++ resources in the /C++ directory.

## Object-Oriented Programming in C++

The Object-Oriented Programming section covers key concepts in C++:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## Data Structures and Algorithms

The Data Structures and Algorithms section includes:

- Linked Lists:
        Explore the implementation and applications of linked lists.
-Stacks:
       Learn how to use stacks for efficient LIFO (Last In First Out) operations.
-Queues:
      Understand the concept of queues and implement them for FIFO (First In First Out) operations.
-Trees:
      Dive into various tree structures like binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
-Sorting and Searching Algorithms:
      Learn and implement efficient sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and searching (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search) algorithms.
-Dynamic Programming:
      Explore the powerful technique of dynamic programming to solve complex problems efficiently.
-Graph Algorithms:
       Learn and implement algorithms for traversing graphs, finding shortest paths, and performing other graph operations.

## Standard Template Library (STL)

Explore the powerful features of the Standard Template Library in C++:

- Containers
- Algorithms
- Iterators
- Function Objects

## Practice Problems

Challenge yourself with a variety of coding exercises in the [Practice Problems](/practice-problems) directory.
