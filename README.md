## Introduction

This repository is designed as a step-by-step guide to strengthen your programming skills. It covers the fundamentals of C, progresses to C++ with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming, and delves into essential Data Structures, Algorithms, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

## Languages

C: You can find the C resources in the /C directory.
C++: You can find the C++ resources in the /C++ directory.

## Object-Oriented Programming in C++

The Object-Oriented Programming section covers key concepts in C++:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## Data Structures and Algorithms

The Data Structures and Algorithms section includes:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms


## Standard Template Library (STL)

Explore the powerful features of the Standard Template Library in C++:

- Containers
- Algorithms
- Iterators
- Function Objects

## Practice Problems

Challenge yourself with a variety of coding exercises in the [Practice Problems](/practice-problems) directory.
